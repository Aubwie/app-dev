# **The Notebook**

This is my favorite movie, because for me, it is the most romantic movie of all time.

This movie is based on a real couple. There's a real life Noah and Allie. Nicholas Spark's book is based on his ex-wife Cathy's grandparents.

*The Notebook* is the first novel Nicholas Sparks published. According to Biography, he started writing books in college but, his first two books were never published.

If you still didn't watch *The Notebook* yet, then you must watch it now. It is about a poor yet passionate young man falls in love with a rich young woman, giving her a sense of freedom, but they are soon separated because of their social differences.
